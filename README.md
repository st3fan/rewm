# (Rust) Emulated Woz Machine
_Stefan Arentz, June 2022_

This is a continuation of my (Emulated Woz Machine)[https://github.com/st3fan/ewm] project, a 6502/65C02 CPU emulator with machine profiles for the Apple One and Apple ][+.

There is nothing here to see yet except some random code that I'm having fun with. It is also a _very slow_ Rust learning project for me.

It will probably take another 7 years to turn this into something that works well enough to play Hard Hat Mac.
